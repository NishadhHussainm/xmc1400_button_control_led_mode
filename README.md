# xmc1400_button_control_led_mode


## Features

- **LED Control**: You can control the state of an LED.
- **Pushbutton Interaction**: LED state changes based on pushbutton presses.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working with this project, make sure you have the following:

- [DAVE IDE](https://www.infineon.com/dave) or a compatible development environment.
- An Infineon XMC microcontroller that supports the provided code.
- Proper hardware setup, including an LED and a pushbutton.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository to your local development environment or download it as a ZIP file.

2. **Open Project**: Launch your DAVE IDE and open the project. Configure it to match your specific target hardware.

3. **Build and Flash**: Build the application within the DAVE IDE and flash it to your XMC microcontroller.

## Usage

### How to Use

1. Connect a pushbutton to the `DIGITAL_IO_0` input.
2. Attach an LED to the `DIGITAL_IO_4` output.

### Pushbutton Interaction

By pressing the pushbutton, you can change the LED state as follows:

- First press: LED OFF.
- Second press: LED ON.
- Third press: Toggle the LED state.
